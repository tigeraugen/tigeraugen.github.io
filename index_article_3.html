                    <p class="mb-0">Damages claims by victims of forced mobilisation against Japanese companies are still ongoing. Furthermore, relations between Japan and South Korea have been fraught with conflict over disputes concerning historical recognition and compensation for victims of forced mobilisation and Japanese military sexual slaves, known as "comfort women".</p>
                    <p></p>


                    <p class="mb-0">Heads of state have repeatedly made political and diplomatic agreements in the name of trilateral co-operation of national security or economic co-operation to deter China and Russia over the issue. However, the voices of the victims have always been sidelined in these agreements. The 1965 Claims Agreement between Korea and Japan and the 2015 Korea-Japan comfort women agreement are prime examples.</p>
                    <p></p>


                    <p class="mb-0">The Japan-Korea Claims Agreement is the result of negotiations between the Republic of Korea and Japan in 1965 to normalise diplomatic relations and economic cooperation. Its full name is the Agreement on the Settlement of Problems concerning Property and Claims and the Economic Cooperation between the Republic of Korea and Japan.</p>

                                Through this agreement, Japan agreed to give up all of its capital invested in Korea and the individual property of Japanese nationals as post-war compensation, as well as "products and services of the Japanese state" worth $300 million. Additionally, it agreed to loan to South Korea $200 million at low interest. President Park Chung-hee, who had come to power in a coup d'état at the time, agreed to waive any claims against Japan for property and debts. However, the agreement excluded any mention of recognition and accountability for Japan's illegal colonial rule, leading to disagreements between the governments over the future of individual claims for damages by victims of forced labour and comfort women. Japan claims that the agreement finally resolves all claims, including those of individual citizens, while the South Korean government maintains that individual claims are not within the scope of the agreement.

                                    On 28 December 2015, the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea met to declare the “final and irreversible settlement” of the Japanese military sex slavery “comfort women” issue, which included an acknowledgement of the Japanese government's responsibility, the establishment of a foundation to redress the harm inflicted on comfort women with 1 billion yen of the Japanese government's budget, and refraining from mutual criticism of the issue in the international community. However, it was criticised for including a clause stating that the South Korean government would endeavour to properly resolve the issue of the Girl of Peace statue, which was erected to commemorate deceased victims of Japanese military sexual slavery. The Japanese government clarified that the approximately 1 billion yen for the foundation does not constitute reparations to the victims, emphasising that it is not legally responsible. The result was criticised as a "backroom deal" that "excluded the voices of the victims".                                    
                                </div>

                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Victims of forced mobilisation began to speak out about their victimisation in the 1990s. They filed lawsuits in Japanese courts, but they were all dismissed on the grounds of 'statute of limitations' and the excuse that 'Japan is not legally obliged to respond because the issue was resolved by the 1965 Claims Agreement between the Republic of Korea and Japan'.</p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">However, the South Korean Supreme Court ruled that the 2012 "Korea-Japan Claims Agreement" was not a negotiation to claim compensation based on Japan's illegal colonial rule, but rather to settle property and civil debt relations between the two countries under Article 4 of the San Francisco Convention. This was interpreted to signify that individuals still retained the right to claim damages and compensation for forced mobilisation resulting from the perpetrator's illegal actions. In 2018, the South Korean Supreme Court ruled that Japanese companies that profited from forced mobilisation were individually liable to compensate victims of forced labour, ordering them to pay around 100 million won to each claimant. However, the Japanese government retaliated with economic sanctions, specifically, removing South Korea from its whitelist of preferential trading partners. The conflict took a turn for the worse when the South Korean government cancelled the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), a bilateral military information protection agreement.</p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">President Yoon Seok-yul, who took office in 2022, sparked a major controversy in March this year when he proposed a "third-party reparations plan" that would be funded by South Korean companies to solve address the issue of forced mobilisation. South Korean companies that profited from the 1965 Japan-Korea Claims Agreement would contribute funds to pay compensation to victims. This was a significant step backwards from the plan proposed by Moon Hee-sang, the speaker of the National Assembly during the Moon Jae-in administration in 2019. This plan sought to compensate victims through a newly set up "Memory, Reconciliation and Future" foundation that would collect donations from South Korean and Japanese companies, the South Korean and Japanese governments, and voluntary contributions from the public. </p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">The incumbent administration's Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with victims and bereaved families, actively encouraging them to accept the plan. Of the 15 forced mobilisation victims and bereaved families whose reparations were confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2018, 11 of them, including 10 surviving victims and one bereaved family member accepted the offer, however, the surviving victims, Ms Yang Geum-duk and Mr Lee Chun-sik, and the bereaved families of deceased victims Park Hae-ok and Jeong Chang-hee, reacted strongly and refused to accept. The current government went ahead and applied to the respective district courts where the victims and bereaved families reside to deposit the reparations, but the courts refused, citing Article 469(1) of the Civil Code, which states that "the repayment of the debt can also be made by a third party. However, this is not the case when the parties do not allow it." The courts also pointed out in the sentencing “In a situation where the perpetrator denies the existence of an unlawful act and does not acknowledge any liability for damages to the victim, the applicant's failure to exercise its right of recourse against the perpetrator after paying off the judgment through third-party reimbursement will result in the perpetrator's impunity.” The Korean government's appeal was also rejected.</p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">On September 4, the Korean government submitted an appeal following the refusal by the court to accept the request of deposit intended for victims of forced mobilisation, and their dismissal of the government's objection. Now, the victims have to bear the burden of responding to the undesirable deposit pushed by south Korean government, on top of their long fight for compensation, a genuine apology and the taking of responsibility by the Japanese government. Ultimately, the two governments have treated the victims with the logic of power in politics and diplomacy and continue to push them into a cycle of secondary perpetration that has undermined their human dignity.</p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Chung Byung-ho, professor emeritus of culture and anthropology at Hanyang University, has criticised the current administration's third-party reparations proposal as "ultra vires(extra-authoritative) intervention". He is one of the organisers of the '70-year homecoming' project, which exhumed and repatriated the remains of the victims of the 1997 Shumarinai forced labor camp in Hokkaido, Japan. </p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">"There are instances where the personal losses of victims of colonialism have been taken and misappropriated by the state or a regime temporarily entrusted with power," said Chung. "The South Korean government must be held accountable, but at the same time, it has no right to give impunity to the Japanese government or corporations that committed crimes of human rights abuses in the past." </p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">"The government's actions will end up as political rhetoric that has no legal standing," he said. "Furthermore, such extra-authoritative interventions will be historically condemned as acts of complicity after the fact. Crimes against humanity have no statute of limitations.", he pointed out. </p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Against this backdrop, the Korea-Japan Historical Justice and Peace Action, a group of over 600 civil society organisations in South Korea, launched a fundraising campaign on 29 June to raise money for the victims and their families who rejected the South Korean government's third-party reparations proposal. On 13 August, after 45 days of fundraising, the 'Action for Historical Justice and Peace between Korea and Japan' paid 100 million won (£60,852, $75300) to each, totalling 400 million won (£243,408, $301500) to four victims and their families who had rejected the South Korean government's proposal for third-party compensation. As of 21 September, 8,477 donations have been collected, reaching about 600 million won (£369,140). The fundraising campaign will continue until June next year.</p>
