Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Forced mobilisation victim Ms Yang Geum-duk is 94 years old (born in 1929), victim of Fujikoshi Ms Kim Jung-ju is 92 years old (born in 1931), and victim of Nippon Steel Mr Lee Chun-sik is 99 years old (born in 1924). According to the status of medical support payments for survivors of Japanese forced mobilisation, which was disclosed by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security through a request for disclosure of information, more than 120,000 victims have passed away in the past 10 years. As of January 2013, there were 14,039 victims who received medical support, but as of January 2023, there were only 1264 victims who received medical support. This means that the number of people who actually experienced and can testify to the history of forced mobilisation is rapidly decreasing.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="mb-0">On 30 October 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the right to individual damages for victims of forced labor and ordered Japanese companies to pay compensation. Mr Lee Chun-sik broke down in tears when asked by reporters after the ruling, saying, "I came out alone today and I feel sad, I have a lot of tears, I'm chocked with tears, and my heart hurts." </p>
                    <p></p>


                    <p class="mb-0">His victory came after 13 years, but he was alone, as his three fellow forced labour victims with whom he had filed the case in 2005 had all passed away. </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">However, despite the Supreme Court's order to pay, the Japanese defendants have failed to do so for five years now. </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Some critics say this is due to the past attitude of the South Korean government, which has been slow to address the suffering of the victims. "Israel has been investigating Jewish victims since 1953, but the Korean government has always considered forced mobilisation as a historical and political issue that needs to be resolved quickly," says Dr Jeong Hye-kyung, an expert on the history of forced mobilisation in Korea, adding, "We have not been able to accumulate research step by step to establish the truth, and we still lack a lot of research."</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">So how should we address this issue? </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Kim Young-hwan, Chief of External Affairs at the Center for Historical Truth and Justic, emphasises that the UN's Basic Principles on the Rights of Victims require factual reassessment based on acknowledgement of the facts, reparations as evidence of apology, punishment of those responsible, and education to prevent recurrence.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">In 2020, Korean and Japanese civil organisations, including the Center for Historical Truth and Justic called for 1. The perpetrating companies to face and acknowledge the human rights violations they committed in good faith; 2. The South Korean government, which has been taking a passive attitude regarding the rights of victims, to fulfil its responsibility and role. 3. Companies that benefited from the 1965 Japan-Korea Claims Settlement Agreement to participate in the redress process; and 4. The governments and companies of both South Korea and Japan to participate in the redress process.</p>
                    <p></p>


                    <p class="mb-0">"The biggest problem is that the South Korean government has exchanged past history issues for security issues," he pointed out. "In addition, President Yoon is making statements that deny the 2018 Supreme Court ruling, which is unconstitutional because it is the executive branch not following the highest judicial ruling."
                    "The victims of forced labour are not a historical issue between Korea and Japan, but an individual human rights issue," he said, "and just as Korean and Japanese civil society organisations have been working in solidarity, we will continue to appeal to the international community's human rights bodies to address the differences in the Japanese government's view of history and perspective."</p>
