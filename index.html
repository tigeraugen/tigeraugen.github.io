                    <p class="lead">
                        The 1930s, about 80 years ago. Japanese Imperialism war ambitions led to people being stripped of their human dignity in harsh labour conditions and war zones.</p>
                    <p class="lead">    
                        But the stories of the victims of forced mobilisation are not stuck in the past, they are still ongoing.</p>
                        <p class="lead">    
                        Victims whose hairs have grown grey are still fighting on, demanding sincere apologies and reparations from the perpetrators. Damage suits against Japanese companies that forced Koreans to work are still being attempted. Victims of forced mobilisation were seized to be 'used' for company profits or to produce war materials without knowing where they were headed. In the mobilisation sites they arrived at, they were subjected to hazardous working conditions that killed them the caused deaths and terrible suffering.<br>
                        <p class="lead">
                            According to the oral testimonies of victims interviewed by the Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilisation under Japanese Colonialism in Korea, they were usually packed into trucks en masse with other young men from their villages under the watchful eye of police officers armed with swords. Some were lured into mobilisation through the false promises of potential earnings, others willingly volunteered to take the place of their fathers who were the breadwinners or young brothers, and families were torn apart as members were mobilised to various locations.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            They arrived at coal mines that could collapse at any moment, to the dam construction sites where explosions rang out, munitions factories, armies, and army brothel.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Those who survived made the journey home in 1945, excited to reunite with their families at the end of the war, but many went missing or died along the way. 
                            This article used a variety of data, including forced mobilisation registers held by the Korean National Archives, advice from experts, and oral testimonies from victims, to trace their movements, breaking down their hometowns and mobilisation sites by region.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            It also looks at the efforts of Japanese civil society organisations to collect and unearth traces of forced mobilisation. Above all, the film seeks to uncover the solidarity of Korean and Japanese citizens, and the value required for lasting peace that people in both countries are defending from below, resisting the logic of political and diplomatic power.

                    <h4>Article 1</h4>
                    <p></p>
                    <h4><b>Forced mobilisation lists, scattered fragments</b></h4>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="mb-0">The current list published by the National Archives of Korea on its official website totals 12,077,225 people (as of September 2023). However, this list is incomplete, as it contains duplicate names and was compiled by translating old Japanese documents and writing down Chinese characters with Korean pronunciations, rather than using the Japanese pronunciation so it is often difficult to understand for the general public. There are also inconsistencies due to the different entities that have been working on the list.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Scholars point to another reason for the incompleteness of the lists: the fact that the statistics produced by the Japanese government, which was involved in the forced mobilisation, varied from one source to another. This is because the different authorities involved in the mobilisation produced the data in different ways and forms. They believe that the most likely reasons for this are the possibility of downsizing during the statistical compilation process and the possibility that Japan lost the war and subsequently burned or concealed unfavourable data. The fact that the numerous lists are unverified also contributes to their incompleteness. However, the scale of forced mobilisation is still being debated and further researched in the academic community. This is due to the continuous discovery of new material by individual researchers from the civil society organisation who have been collecting material for the past two or three decades.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-0">Forced mobilisation lists are like scattered fragments, but within them, we can find clues that allow us to trace the facts: the scale, routes, and actual circumstances of the victims.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0"><b>Fukuoka, Hokkaido, and Nagasaki, areas with many coal mines, have the highest proportion of victims of forced mobilisation on the list</b></p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Based on the lists provided by the National Archives (1,076,450) and the forced mobilisation data available on the official website (1,277,250/ 1,336,000 de-duplicated), it was possible to compile keywords that could be used to trace mobilisation sites. After analysing the data, we found that there were approximately 140,000 cases where we could trace the location of the mobilisation. The region in Japan where the most victims were mobilised was Fukuoka (26,126). Second was Hokkaido (25,407) and third was Nagasaki (14,423). Looking at the top five prefectures by number, Hokkaido and Kyushu had the highest number of victims of forced labour on the list, both of which were home to a high concentration of coal and metal mines. </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">In fact, if we look at the outcome report released by the Commission in 2016, coal mines accounted for the largest number of victims. Among the total number of victims (780,043) who were recruited for corporate quotas and public institutions, 356,995 (44.74%) were in coal mines. Metal mines also accounted for 70,268 (9.94%). </p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>


                        <p class="mb-0">So what was life like for those who went to the mines? </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">In particular, victims who survived the mines recall that every day was a battle with death. </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Park Yong-sik (78 years old at the time of the interview) said, "There were a few people who came out of the mines unharmed," adding, "Legs were cut off, hands were cut off, bones were broken. Two-thirds of them were injured," he recalled. "It's not like, 'I'm glad I didn't die. You're being blamed for being injured because you were stupid," he said.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Kim Gap-duk (81 years old at the time of the interview), who was mobilised in 1943, also describes in detail the frequent accidents in the coal mines. "When there was an accident, people were pushing into the crowds", he explained, "People were carried out on stretchers, many people died in very bad falls, and many people died in bomb misfires".</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Yoon Byung-ryel, who was mobilised to the Kamoi coal mine in Hokkaido in 1942, said, "Back then, people said that they carried their soul on their waist in the mine because they could die anytime. So, after breakfast, I would put my bento lunchbox in my mesh bag, thinking about whether I would live or day that day.", adding that his daily life was a constant battle between life and death.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Many of them continued to work under harsh conditions by eating soybean cake(Kongketmuk, 콩깻묵). It was the leftover residue from pressing soybean oil, which is usually used as feed or fertiliser for livestock, mixed with miscellaneous grains and rolled into two balls slightly smaller than a fist. This became the soybean cake that the victims ate for their daily meals. </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">"We were hungry, and that was the hardest part," says Kim, recalling the soybean cake, which was dotted with barely visible grains of rice and barley.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0"><b>Number of people dragged into forced mobilisation</b>
                    </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Analysing the number of people on the list whose date of birth has been recorded, those born in 1924 dominate with 120,000 out of a total of 724,272. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-0">Next were those born in 1923 (50580), 1922 (43040), and 1921 (38,532). Assuming they were born in 1924, they would have been 15 years old in 1939, when forced mobilisation began in earnest; assuming they were born in 1943 or 1944 when mobilisation increased dramatically as Japan entered the final stages of the war, they would have been 19 or 20 years old when dragged to the mobilisation sites.  </p>

                    <p></p> <p class="mb-0">So where were the victims from? </p>

                    <p></p> <p class="mb-0">Looking at the data, Gyeongseongbu (now Seoul) in Gyeonggi-do province had the highest number of victims, with Uisung-Gun and Sangju-gun in Gyeongsangbuk-do coming in second and third, respectively, followed by Goheung-gun in Jeollanam-do, Kimje county in Jeollabuk-do, and Seosan-gun in Chungcheongnam-do.  </p>

                    <p></p> <p class="mb-0">The commission estimates that at least 7.8 million people(man-days) were forcibly mobilised as of 2016. However, as this figure is based on selective data provided by the Japanese government and the research of survivors who returned alive, the actual number is likely to far exceed this.</p>
