                    <h4><b>People have been tracing the trail of forced labour</b></h4>

                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Forced mobilisation has been a tragic narrative in South Korean history for around 80 years. But war crimes and horrific historical facts are increasingly being erased from Japanese history textbooks, and those who remember it are rapidly diminishing as well. Only those who were or close to the generation that experienced the Japanese colonisation and war still remember. Nevertheless, there are people who have for decades been doggedly collecting evidence of forced labour in their local area. Their efforts have unearthed the remains of those who have been silently buried, bringing to light the horrors of war and keeping the memory alive.</p>
                    <p></p>


                    <p class="mb-0">In this section, you will find three extraordinary examples of how Korean and Japanese citizens endeavoured to unearth the traces of the horrific forced mobilisation perpetrated by Japanese Imperialism.</p>
                    <p></p>


                    <p class="mb-0">In Shumarinai, Horokanai Town, Hokkaido, Japan, there is the Sasanobohyo Museum (笹の墓標展示館 - Museum of Forced Labour). In 1976, monk Yoshihiko Tonohira discovered more than 80 memorial plaques of victims of forced labour behind the former Kokenji Temple (光顕寺). He realised that they were Korean victims of forced mobilisation for the construction of the Shumarinai Lake dam and the Shin-Mei Line railway in Hokkaido. Tonohira created a civic organisation called the Sorachi Civil History Lecture, and began to investigate the ward office, implicated companies, and local residents. In 1997, the 'Korea-Japan University Student Workshop' was held, bringing together more than 250 university students from Korea and Japan, as well as Koreans living in Japan, to work together on exhuming the remains of the victims of forced mobilisation and organise materials. Since then, seven exhumations have taken place over 40 years since the 1970s. The group built the Sasa no Bohyo Exhibition Hall and Forced Labour Museum, and in 2015, 115 remains of victims of forced labour exhumed were laid to rest at the Seoul Metropolitan Cemetery in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. The skeletal remains of Koreans who lost their lives in a foreign country and were clandestinely buried returned to their homeland after 70 years.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">
                        <span class="small-gray-text">This photograph was taken by Masaharu Oka on 29 April 1993, following an investigation related to forced mobilisation of the Kitagata coal mine in Saga Prefecture, Japan. Rev. Oka is the second person from the right. </span> 
                    </p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>


                    <p class="mb-0">The second is Oka Masaharu Memorial Nagasaki Peace Museum, which was established to commemorate human rights activist and member of the Nagasaki City Council, Masaharu Oka(岡正治), who served as the head of the Nagasaki Committee to Protect the Human Rights of Koreans in Japan. In the early 1980s, the group carried out a survey of Korean victims of the atomic bombing in Nagasaki. Its main purpose was to find out where and how many Koreans died in Nagasaki when the atomic bomb was dropped on the city on 9 August 1945, right before the end of second world war. As the investigation progressed, they gradually expanded their scope to Nagasaki's neighbouring prefecture, Saga. These unanswered questions; why Koreans were bombed in Nagasaki, where exactly they died, and the number of casualties incurred; led to the investigation of forced mobilisation and forced labour. In order to uncover the truth, they also needed to find out when, how, from where and under what circumstances the Koreans came to Nagasaki. They carried out fact-finding activities at local sites, and based on the materials, valuable testimonies, and data collected in the process, they held exhibitions and seminars with a vivid sense of place. In addition, they organise a diverse range of lectures, rallies, and symposiums in various formats based on the history of Japanese aggression and perpetration, and play a leading role in awakening citizens to a view of history they had not known before.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">In a video interview, Tomohiro Shinkai, deputy director of the Oka Masaharu Memorial Nagasaki Peace Museum, said, "Our founding purpose is a short sentence, but in it the word 'perpetration' is used several times in different forms, as 'history of perpetration,' 'perpetrators,' 'responsibility for perpetration,' and 'truth of perpetration'. The reason why we place emphasis on the word 'perpetration' is that most of the war-related museums in Japanese society only show aspects of the damage suffered by the Japanese people, such as air raids and atomic bombs, and remain silent about the reality of invasion and colonisation centred on the Korean Peninsula and China." In particular, he points out that the horrific experience of "victimisation" in the bombed city of Nagasaki has made their past perpetrations even more invisible. The idea that this should be properly acknowledged rather than turned a blind eye to is what the phrase 'call for Japan's accountability' signifies.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Their work has expanded into alliances and collaborations with other organisations with the same concerns and objectives. They have worked in partnership with many organisations, including the group investigating the truth of the Nagasaki Chinese forced internment, the group supporting the trial of the Nagasaki Chinese forced internment, and the Forced Mobilisation Truth and Reconciliation Network. More recently, they have been collaborating with young artists living in Fukuoka to plan and conduct exhibitions and events together.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">During the interview, Shinkai also stated, "The reason we are obsessed with collecting testimonies is that we recognise the importance of the testimonies of those who experienced it in order to convey to future generations the individual and specific facts of history that are missing from official documents," and "it also leads to empathising with the pain of the victims."</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">
                        <span class="small-gray-text">Tsuga Dam in Kochi Prefecture, Shikoku, Japan, under construction in 1944. </span> 
                    </p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">The last example is Hata Semina, an organisation of high school students in Kochi Prefecture, Shikoku, who have been working to excavate the remains and historical documents of Korean victims of forced mobilisation. Hata Semina was formed in August 1983 as a federated club of local high schools and has been excavating folk history and modern history of resistance to unjust state power. From 1989 onwards, they tackled the issue of the forced mobilisation of Koreans. They interviewed local residents who remembered the period dominated by massive forced mobilization and conducted fieldwork, visiting the Tsuga Dam more than 100 times. Gradually, innumerable traces of forced mobilisation began to emerge, including the presence of unmarked graves scattered around the Tsuga Dam. They discovered that around 20 Koreans were forcibly recruited to build a military road on Kashiwajima Island in Kochi Prefecture in 1944. They also found out that Park Lee-dong, born in Jinsan-ri, Soan-myeon, Wando-gun, Jeollanam-do, Korea, died at the site on 5 February 1944 when a flying iron stick pierced his left eye while he was rock blasting. Hata Semina erected a memorial to Park's death on the 50th anniversary in 1995. The money for the memorial was raised by local residents and the foundation stone was brought from South Korea. They located Mr. Park's surviving daughter in Korea, guiding her to the mausoleum.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Park's remains were returned to his hometown at the request of the bereaved family, more than 60 years after he was taken to a distant land by forced mobilisation. They also obtained a list found in 2005 in the warehouse of the Taisho Village Office by the Village History Compilation Committee. It was a "census sheet" from the old Taisho office, containing a list of accommodations and workers at the Tsuga Dam construction site. They also found a record of 666 people who were the construction site, including their families, although it didn't include their all names. They assume that there were at least 300 Koreans who contributed to the construction of Tsuga Dam based on residents' testimonies. Hata Semina also obtained testimony that about 20 young men were kept in isolation at the rear of the accommodation. They were numbered and placed under constant surveillance. If they tried to run away, they were caught and beaten.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">"The high school students in Hata Semina thought that the forced mobilisation had nothing to do with them, but they were surprised and frightened by the footprints of the Korean victims who remained in the nearby area, and they came to face the fact of the perpetration," says Kamioka Hashihira who is a secretary general in Hata-seminar. "They dug up the historical facts of the area and informed many people about it through various expression activities, and developed it into a Japan-Korea exchange." he added.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p class="mb-0">"Both the previous Abe administration and the current one said to follow the 'Kono discourse' but their words and actions do not match," said Kamioka, adding, "In Japan, it is important to know the facts of perpetration and resistance. Important historical facts are not being passed on to young people. That's the problem."</p>
